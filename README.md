# Research Advice from the CRL
This repository contains an updateable list of advice on how to do research and how to communicate effectively. It is biased towards computer science.
This repository is inspired by various online lists that contain great information but often also deprecated links like Mark Leone's great Advice on Research and Writing

## Research Skills
> This section contains skills you will need in research independent of your career level. Maybe you want to start doing research in a new field. Then this is the section to look into.

+ [Graduate Study in the Computer and Mathematical Sciences: A Survival Manual](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~oleary/gradstudy/gradstudy.html) by O'Leary
+ [How to Succeed in Graduate School (Part I)](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/teaching/spring2005/fft/acm_gradschool.htm) by desJardins

## Databases
> This section contains databases for your research. Use them to find articles on various topics and in many disciplines. These databases help you to do literature reviews if you are embarking on your next literature research.

+ [DBLP](https://dblp.org/search/)
+ [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
+ [Web of Science](https://webofknowledge.com) - Web of Science.
+ [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) - Open access to e-prints in nearly every field
+ [Springer](https://link.springer.com/) - Access to many scientific documents from journals, books, series, protocols, and proceedings.
+ [ieeexplore.ieee.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) - IEEE Xplore Digital Library
+ [ACM](https://dl.acm.org/) - Association for Computing Machinery

## Ethics
> This section contains various links to ethics and good practices in research. These are mostly the standards that all researchers adhere to.

+[Living guidelines on the Responsible Use of Generative AI in Research](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/2b6cf7e5-36ac-41cb-aab5-0d32050143dc_en?filename=ec_rtd_ai-guidelines.pdf) - A document by the European Commission on the ethical usage of generative AI in science. For students p. 1-7 are most relevant
+ [Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice](https://www.dfg.de/resource/blob/174052/1a235cb138c77e353789263b8730b1df/kodex-gwp-en-data.pdf) - Guidelines on good research practice by the DFG. If you are doing a Ph.D. in Germany you most likely acknowledged to adhere these.
