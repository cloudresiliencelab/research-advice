# Research Advice from the CRL
This repository contains an updateable list of advice on conducting research and communicating effectively. Furthermore, it will in the future serve as a repository for curated research papers. It is biased towards computer science.
This repository is inspired by various online lists that contain great information but often also deprecated links like Mark Leone's great Advice on Research and Writing
